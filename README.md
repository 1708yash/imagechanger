Image Converter Application
This project is a graphical user interface (GUI) application developed in Python using the Tkinter library. It allows users to convert images from one format to another, providing a user-friendly interface with standard window controls and robust functionality.

Features
Standard Window Controls: The application window includes minimize, maximize, and close buttons, allowing users to control the window as typical desktop applications.

Resizable Window: Users can resize the application window to their preference, enhancing usability across different screen sizes.

Image Conversion: The core functionality enables users to select an image file and convert it to a different format (e.g., JPEG to PNG).

Stable Interface: Addressed previous issues where the application would minimize upon clicking the 'Convert Image' button, ensuring a seamless user experience.
